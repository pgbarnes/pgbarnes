## üî¨ About me
#### Pronouns: they/them
Hello! My name is P. I am a senior Biology major with minors in Data Science and Poverty Studies at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, VA! As a student with 3 years of undergraduate research experience in biology, sociology, and data science, I am passionate about using the skills I have learnt in the classroom and lab to systematically address the issues I care about.

## üöß Current Projects
As of right now, I am wrapping up my undergraduate career and applying for future opportunities. Outside of my studies, I am getting familiar with SQL using leetcode and other available resources.

### üçø  Neuroscience and Biology Research w/ Dr. I'Anson: Exploring Snacking's Role in the Development of Metabolic Disease using a Novel Snacking Rat Model
Currently, we are finishing up final quantification, data analysis, and just started writing our paper on the impacts of snacking from weaning in our novel female rat model!


### üå°Ô∏è  Bio 201 Biostatistics Final Project: How Long to Wait Before Using an Infrared No-Touch Forehead Thermometer After Wearing Headwear
Overview: For my final for my Biostatistics course, I along with a team of other students created and implimented an experiment to verify the quality of a provided medical device. We were assigned an Infrared No-Touch Forehead Thermometer (INTFT) and noticed there was no guidelines regarding headwear and its effect of temperature on the device's measurement. Therefore, we created an experiment to find a reasonable parameter to include in the device's manual to improve its ease of use. We are currently finshing the report. All data analysis was conducted in excel.

## üìä Past Projects

#### üß† Bio 187 Intro to Python Final Project: Inhibition of Iron and its Effect on Neuroinflammation
Overview: For this group project, we were given gene expression data for control and treatment mice from Dr. Katie Volk's lab from Vanderbilt University. We were assigned to investigate potential genes that are affected by the treatment which blocked iron uptake in the brain and how it affected the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. Data analysis was completed in Python. Every figure was coded in 25 lines or less (excluding created functions).

Experimental Design for the data.

One of our final figures. The Principal Component Analysis revealed some of the key differences in gene expression between diseased mice with treatment (KDLPS), who more aligned with the control (saline), versus diseased mice without treatment (LPS). We also identified KD LPS mice who did not properly uptake the genetic knockdown treatment as they were more similar to LPS mice than saline mice.  



#### ‚è∞ Bio 297 Behavioral Data Science Final Project: Exploring Behavioral Patterns in SCN DKO and Control Mice
Overview: Similar to my previous work on my Bio 187 final project, we were provided rat activity data from Dr. Lauren Woodie's lab from University of Pennsylvania. We were assigned to identify which animals have received a neurological treatment that affected their behavior versus the control animals. We had to calculat each animal's activity period based on the raw data then utilized autcorrelation and raster plots to visualize the differences in acitivity to make our final decision. This project was recommended by our professor, Dr. Toporikova, to be submitted to the Undergraduate Class Project competition.

Raster plots visualizing the activity of the animals. Scatterplot compares the light and dark period of each animal. The red dashed line demonstrates the highest period length of the SCN DKO animals of 22.37 hours.

#### ü´Ç Soan 244 Personal Netowrks & Social Capital: The Influence of Student‚Äôs Ethnoracial Identity and Greek Life Affiliation on their Sense of Belonging and Network Structure
Overview: For this course, the final project was an individual paper where we had the opportunity to explore a sociological question, where we utilized data from the survey we created as a class.  I chose to explore how Greek affiliation impacts students‚Äô sense of belonging and network structure differently based on their racial identity.

Linear regression plots of the relationship between constraint and sense of belonging by both racial identity and Greek organization membership.


#### ü¶† Independent Study: How COVID-19 Deaths Varied over Time by Race & Ethnicity in the U.S.
Overview: I decided to do an individual research analysis to explore how COVID-19 mortality affected different racial and age groups, as well as the interactions between the two factors. All data was from the CDC and all figures were made in R. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/256fddfb-4726-4ce3-b77c-a80a05a98aaa)
In this graph, we can see how COVID-19 mortality rates have overall dropped from 2020 to 2023. Interestingly, we can see a large spike in COVID-19 mortality rates around March to April in 2020, a crucial time during the pandemic. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd52552-4adc-4a69-bb69-e1de36296499)
In this graph, it seems that certain ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, and Hispanic) also have non-proportionally higher mortality rates for a younger age demographics,65-74 years group, in comparison to the Non-Hispanic White group.


#### üåé Summer 2024 Sociology and Data Science Research w/ Dr. Eastwood: Exploring Cyncisim Around the World
Overview: This past summer, I was a part of Dr. Eastwood's sociology and data science lab. We analyzed comparative survey data about cynicism, trust, and distrust using the Worlds Value Survey, as well as did our own individual analysis regarding a specific area of interest. I investigated how social status impacts trust.
