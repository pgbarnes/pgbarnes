Hello! My name is P. I am a senior Biology major with minors in Data Science and Poverty Studies at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, VA! As a student with 3 years of undergraduate research experience in biology, sociology, and data science, I am passionate about using the skills I have learnt in the classroom and lab to systematically address the issues I care about.

## 🚧 Current Projects
As of right now, I am wrapping up my undergraduate career and applying for future opportunities. Outside of my studies, I am getting familiar with SQL using leetcode and other available resources.

#### 🐁 + 🍿 - Neuroscience and Biology Research w/ Dr. I'Anson: Exploring Snacking's Role in the Development of Metabolic Disease using a Novel Snacking Rat Model
Currently, we are finishing up final quantification, data analysis, and just started writing our paper on the impacts of snacking from weaning!

#### 🌡️ + 🧣 - Bio 201 Biostatistics Final Project: How Long to Wait Before Using an Infrared No-Touch Forehead Thermometer After Wearing Headwear
Overview: For my final for my Biostatistics course, I along with a team of other students created and implimented an experiment to verify the quality of a provided medical device. We were assigned an Infrared No-Touch Forehead Thermometer (INTFT) and noticed there was no guidelines regarding headwear and its effect of temperature on the device's measurement. Therefore, we created an experiment to find a reasonable parameter to include in the device's manual to improve its ease of use. We are currently finshing the report. All data analysis was conducted in excel.
