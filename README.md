## 🔬 About me
### Pronouns: they/them
Hello! My name is P. I am a senior Biology major with minors in Data Science and Poverty Studies at Washington & Lee University in Lexington, VA! As a student with 3 years of undergraduate research experience in biology, sociology, and data science, I am passionate about using the skills I have learnt in the classroom and lab to systematically address the issues I care about. 



## 💻 Programming Languages

## 🚧 Current Projects
As of right now, I am wrapping up my undergraduate career and applying for future opportunities. Outside of my studies, I am getting familiar with SQL using leetcode and other available resources.

#### 🍿 - Neuroscience and Biology Research w/ Dr. I'Anson: Exploring Snacking's Role in the Development of Metabolic Disease using a Novel Snacking Rat Model
Currently, we are finishing up final quantification, data analysis, and just started writing our paper on the impacts of snacking from weaning!

#### 🌡️ - Bio 201 Biostatistics Final Project: How Long to Wait Before Using an Infrared No-Touch Forehead Thermometer After Wearing Headwear
Overview: For my final for my Biostatistics course, I along with a team of other students created and implimented an experiment to verify the quality of a provided medical device. We were assigned an Infrared No-Touch Forehead Thermometer (INTFT) and noticed there was no guidelines regarding headwear and its effect of temperature on the device's measurement. Therefore, we created an experiment to find a reasonable parameter to include in the device's manual to improve its ease of use. We are currently finshing the report. All data analysis was conducted in excel.

## 📊 Past Projects

#### 🧠 - Bio 187 Intro to Python Final Project: Inhibition of Iron and its Effect on Neuroinflammation
Overview: For this group project, we were given gene expression data for control and treatment mice from Dr. Katie Volk's lab from Vanderbilt University. We were assigned to investigate potential genes that are affected by the treatment which blocked iron uptake in the brain and how it affected the progression of Alzheimer's Disease. Data analysis was completed in Python. Every figure was coded in 25 lines or less (excluding created functions).

One of our final figures. The Principal Component Analysis revealed some of the key differences in gene expression between diseased mice with treatment (KDLPS), who more aligned with the control (saline), versus diseased mice without treatment (LPS). We also identified KD LPS mice who did not properly uptake the genetic knockdown treatment as they were more simialr to LPS mice than saline mice.  



#### ⏰ - Bio 297 Behavioral Data Science Final Project: Exploring Behavioral Patterns in SCN DKO and Control Mice
Overview: Similar to my previous work on my Bio 187 final project, we were provided activity data from  

#### 🫂 - Soan 244 Personal Netowrks & Social Capital: The Influence of Student’s Ethnoracial Identity and Greek Life Affiliation on their Sense of Belonging and Network Structure
Overview: 

#### 🦠 - Independent Study: How COVID-19 Deaths Varied over Time by Race & Ethnicity in the U.S.
Overview: 

#### 🌎 - Summer 2024 Sociology and Data Science Research w/ Dr. Eastwood: Exploring Cyncisim Around the World
